# Leaflet Map with Animated Timelines
Sample code using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), 
the leaflet plugin [L.Polyline.SnakeAnim](https://github.com/IvanSanchez/Leaflet.Polyline.SnakeAnim), 
and a few other libraries.

# Compatibility and Dependencies
This code should conceptually be compatible with everything as far back as IE 11 (thus, why I'm using d3.js v4 for the data munging).

# Licensing
My explicit intention is that this code can be easily used and reused, even in a commercial setting. 
I'm using an MIT license as the least restrictive and most legally rigorous license I know. 
If this is still a problem contact me.
